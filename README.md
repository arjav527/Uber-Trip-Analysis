# Uber Trip Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook (`Uber Trip Analysis.ipynb`) analyzes Uber trip data from April to September 2014. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling of trip counts.

## Overview

This analysis explores Uber trip patterns, trends, and factors influencing trip demand in New York City during the specified period. It covers data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and the development of a Random Forest Regressor model to predict trip counts.

## Setup

To run this notebook, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Data Source
The dataset consists of six CSV files, one for each month from April to September 2014:

uber-raw-data-apr14.csv

uber-raw-data-may14.csv

uber-raw-data-jun14.csv

uber-raw-data-jul14.csv

uber-raw-data-aug14.csv

uber-raw-data-sep14.csv

These files should be located in the same directory as the notebook or placed in a subdirectory (e.g., data/).

Data Description
Each CSV file contains Uber trip data for a specific month. The columns are:

Date/Time: Date and time of the Uber trip. (Object)

Lat: Latitude of the pickup location. (Float64)

Lon: Longitude of the pickup location. (Float64)

Base: Code of the TLC-licensed base station. (Object)

Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib.pyplot: For basic plotting.

seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.

scikit-learn:

train_test_split: To split data into training and testing sets.

GridSearchCV: To tune hyperparameters of the model.

RandomForestRegressor: The regression model used for prediction.

mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_absolute_error: Metrics to evaluate model performance.

Analysis Tasks
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load individual monthly CSV files into pandas DataFrames.

Convert the Date/Time column to datetime objects.

Extract hour, day, day of the week, and month from the Date/Time column to create new features.

Concatenate the monthly DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize trip distribution across hours of the day using histograms.

Analyze trip patterns by day of the week.

Examine monthly trip trends to identify seasonal patterns.

Explore the spatial distribution of trips using scatter plots (visualizing Lat and Lon).

Predictive Modeling:

Prepare the data for modeling by selecting relevant features (hour, day, dayofweek, month).

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a Random Forest Regressor model.

Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Visualize actual vs. predicted trip counts.

Determine and visualize feature importance to understand which factors most influence trip counts.

Key Findings
Hourly Patterns: Trip demand varies significantly throughout the day, with peak hours generally occurring in the late afternoon and evening.

Daily Patterns: Trip demand also varies across the days of the week, with certain days showing higher or lower demand.

Monthly Trends: There are noticeable monthly trends in trip demand, possibly indicating seasonal effects or overall growth.

Spatial Distribution: Trips are concentrated in certain areas of the city, reflecting population density and activity centers.

Model Performance: The Random Forest Regressor model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting trip counts, with specific MSE, R², and MAE values (these should be updated with the actual values from your notebook run).

Feature Importance: The model identified the relative importance of different features in predicting trip counts (e.g., hour of the day might be more important than the month).

Further Exploration
External Data: Incorporate external data such as weather information, public transport schedules, or event calendars to improve the model's accuracy.

Spatial Analysis: Conduct more in-depth spatial analysis to identify hotspots, cluster trip origins and destinations, or analyze traffic patterns.

Demand Forecasting: Develop more sophisticated time series models to forecast future trip demand.

Price Optimization: Analyze trip pricing data (if available) to explore price elasticity or optimize pricing strategies.

Other Models: Experiment with other regression models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to compare performance.

How to Run the Notebook
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Place the six CSV files (uber-raw-data-apr14.csv to `uber-raw-data-sep14.csv)
